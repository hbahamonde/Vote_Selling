# Still for Sale: The Micro-Dynamics of Vote Selling in the United States, Evidence From a List Experiment

## Abstract

In nineteenth-century United States politics, vote buying was commonplace. Nowadays, vote buying seems to have declined.  The quantitative empirical literature emphasizes vote buying, ignoring the micro-dynamics of vote selling. We seem to know that vote buyers can no longer afford this strategy; however, we do not know what American voters would do if offered the chance to sell their vote. Would they sell, and at what price, or would they consistently opt out of vote selling? A novel experimental dataset representative at the national level comprises  1,479 U.S. voters who participated in an online list experiment in 2016, and the results are striking: Approximately  25% would sell their vote for a minimum payment of  $418. Democrats and Liberals are more likely to sell, while education or income levels do not seem to impact the likelihood of vote selling.
