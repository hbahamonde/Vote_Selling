We define party systems as competitive when citizens and politicians have strong incentives to try hard to win supporters at the margin for one or the other partisan camp. . principal--agent accountability . Local or small-scale public goods allow the ruling party to employ geographic targeting according to the landscape of political units as in Diaz-Cayeros, Magaloni, and Weingast (2002). . This is the reason why we believe public goods are always riskier than private outlays. . For a discussion of clientelism as supply and demand based, see Shefter, Martin (1994), and Piattoni (2001). . We believe, however, that public jobs are only one of many possible instruments that politicians use to deal with this problem. In the analysis that follows, we implicitly assume that the more a party can target transfers, the better it can solve the commitment problem. . Yo: organizational capabilities: size have an incidence in how difficult is for people to organize and reject the incumbent. . Private transfers can be extremely expensive due to the transaction costs that must be overcome for effective targeting and to the amount of vote-buying needed to ensure election victories. . In contrast, public goods reduce transaction costs and aremore cost-effective per beneficiary. But they aremuch riskier than pri- vate goods. .},

@article{Kam2016b,
	Abstract = {This article examines the impact of the secret ballot on the market for votes at parliamentary elections in the 19th-century United Kingdom. I use a formal model of an exchange between a candidate and a voter to predict the impact of the secret ballot on bribe prices, the marginal effect campaign spending on candidates' electoral prospects, and election turnout. I test these predictions against original data on bribe prices and campaign expenditures at over 500 parliamentary elections. The results are consistent with the argument that the secret ballot induced British parliamentary candidates to divert their campaign spending away from vote-buying and toward turnout-buying. These results point to the adaptability of political actors in the face of institutional changes.},

@article{Auerbach2018,
	Abstract = {Conventional models of clientelism often assume poor voters have little or no choice over which local broker to turn to for help. Yet communities in many clientelistic settings are marked by multiple brokers who compete for a following. Such competition makes client choices, and the preferences guiding such choices, pivotal in fueling broker support. We examine client preferences for a pervasive broker---slum leaders---in the context of urban India. To identify resident preferences for slum leaders, we conducted an ethnographically informed conjoint survey experiment with 2,199 residents across 110 slums in two Indian cities. Contra standard emphases on shared ethnicity, we find residents place heaviest weight on a broker's capability to make claims on the state. A survey of 629 slum leaders finds client-preferred traits distinguish brokers from residents. In highlighting processes of broker selection, and the client preferences that undergird them, we underscore the centrality of clients in shaping local brokerage environments.},

@article{Imai2014a,
	Abstract = {The list experiment, also known as the item count technique, is becoming increasingly popular as a survey methodology for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions. Recently, multivariate regression techniques have been developed to predict the unobserved response to sensitive questions using respondent characteristics. Nevertheless, no method exists for using this predicted response as an explanatory variable in another regression model. We address this gap by first improving the performance of a naive two-step estimator. Despite its simplicity, this improved two-step estimator can only be applied to linear models and is statistically inefficient. We therefore develop a maximum likelihood estimator that is fully efficient and applicable to a wide range of models. We use a simulation study to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed methods. We also apply them to the Mexico 2012 Panel Study and examine whether vote-buying is associated with increased turnout and candidate approval. The proposed methods are implemented in open-source software.},

This design is useful when researchers are interested in the question of which respondents are likely to exhibit social desirability bias (Section 2.2). By comparing answers to direct and indirect questioning, Gilens, Sniderman, and Kuklinski (1998) and Janus (2010) examine the magnitude of social desirability bias with respect to affirmative action and immigration policy, respectively. THIS IS GOOD. I COULD PUT THE VOTE-SELLING QUESTION AND AT THE END, OUT A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH DO YOU SUPPORT THE DEMOCRACY. -The order of items on the partial and full lists may be randomized to minimize order effects. - assume that the inclusion of a sensitive item has no effect on respondents' answers to control items: the addition of the sensitive item does not change the sum of affirmative answers to the control items. - choose control items such that few respondents in the control group would answer affirmatively or negatively to all control items. For example, researchers maychoose control items whose responses are negatively correlated with each other (Glynn 2010). . Ideally, control items should be chosen such that fewer extreme responses are observed in the control group. THAT IS, TRY TO COME UP WITH ITEMS THAT IDEALLY HAVE NEGATIVE ANSWERS.},

@article{Gray2014,
	Abstract = {When something is wrong, someone is harmed. This hypothesis derives from the theory of dyadic morality, which suggests a moral cognitive template of wrongdoing agent and suffering patient (i.e., victim). This dyadic template means that victimless wrongs (e.g., masturbation) are psychologically incomplete, compelling the mind to perceive victims even when they are objectively absent. Five studies reveal that dyadic completion occurs automatically and implicitly: Ostensibly harmless wrongs are perceived to have victims (Study 1), activate concepts of harm (Studies 2 and 3), and increase perceptions of suffering (Studies 4 and 5). These results suggest that perceiving harm in immorality is intuitive and does not require effortful rationalization. This interpretation argues against both standard interpretations of moral dumbfounding and domain-specific theories of morality that assume the psychological existence of harmless wrongs. Dyadic completion also suggests that moral dilemmas in which wrongness (deontology) and harm (utilitarianism) conflict are unrepresentative of typical moral cognition.

	Abstract = {In recent years, parties and candidates challenging key democratic norms have won unprecedented popular support in liberal democracies across the globe. Drawing on public opinion data from the World Values Survey and various national polls, we show that the success of anti-establishment parties and candidates is not a temporal or geographic aberration, but rather a reflection of growing popular disaffection with liberal-democratic norms and institutions, and of increasing support for authoritarian interpretations of democracy. The record number of anti-system politicians in office raises uncertainty about the strength of supposedly ``consolidated'' liberal democracies and highlights the need for further analysis of the signs of democratic deconsolidation.},

I distinguish between the theoretical purposes of case studies and the case selection strategies or research de-signs used to advance those objectives. I construct a typology of case studies based on their purposes: idiographic (inductive and theory-guided), hypothesis-generating, hypothesis-testing, and plausibility probe case studies. I then examine different case study research designs, including comparable cases, most and least likely cases, deviant cases, and process tracing, with attention to their different purposes and logics of infer-ence. I address the issue of selection bias and the " single logic " debate, and I emphasize the utility of multi-method research.},

@article{Graham2009,
	Abstract = {How and why do moral judgments vary across the political spectrum? To test moral foundations theory (J. Haidt {\&} J. Graham, 2007; J. Haidt {\&} C. Joseph, 2004), the authors developed several ways to measure people's use of 5 sets of moral intuitions: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity. Across 4 studies using multiple methods, liberals consistently showed greater endorsement and use of the Harm/care and Fairness/reciprocity foundations compared to the other 3 foundations, whereas conservatives endorsed and used the 5 foundations more equally. This difference was observed in abstract assessments of the moral relevance of foundation-related concerns such as violence or loyalty (Study 1), moral judgments of statements and scenarios (Study 2), "sacredness" reactions to taboo trade-offs (Study 3), and use of foundation-related words in the moral texts of religious sermons (Study 4). These findings help to illuminate the nature and intractability of moral disagreements in the American "culture war."},

	Abstract = {Vote buying and political intimidation are characteristic dimensions of African election campaigns. According to survey-based estimates, almost one out of five Nigerians is personally exposed to vote buying and almost one in ten experiences threats of electoral violence. But when, as commonly happens, campaign irregularities are targeted at the rural poor, effects are concentrated. These effects are as follows: violence reduces turnout; and vote buying enhances partisan loyalty. But, perhaps because most citizens condemn campaign manipulation as wrong, compliance with the wishes of politicians is not assured. Defection from threats and agreements is more common than compliance, especially where voters are cross-pressured from both sides of the partisan divide.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Few issues in athletics today receive more attention than drug and alcohol usage, especially when it comes to college athletics. We seek to address self-report biases related to drug usage and heavy drinking. Methods: We employ an experimental measurement technique. Results: Our results suggest that a greater percentage of student-athletes from a major conference knowingly engage in these two behaviors than self-reports indicate. Specifically, we find 37 percent of respondents seem to have taken banned performance-enhancing drugs (compared to 4.9 percent who directly admit to doing so when asked), and 46 percent seem to have consumed more than five drinks in a week (compared to about 3 percent who openly admit to doing so). Conclusions: We provide evidence for the extent of self-underreporting when it comes to drug and alcohol usage among college athletes. That said, future work is needed to accurately pinpoint specific substances and the frequency with which they are taken; for example, it could be the percentage of individuals using banned substances stems from consuming significant concentrations of caffeine (e.g., multiple cups of coffee).},
