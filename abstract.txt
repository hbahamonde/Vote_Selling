In nineteenth-century United States politics, vote-buying was commonplace. Nowadays, vote-buying seems to have declined. Yet, the quantitative empirical literature emphasizes  vote-buying, ignoring the micro-dynamics of vote-selling. We seem to know that vote-buyers can no longer afford this strategy; however, we do not know what American voters would do if offered the chance to sell their votes. Would they sell their votes (and at what price), or would they consistently opt out of vote-selling? Exploiting a novel experimental dataset representative at the national level,  1,479 U.S. voters participated in an online list experiment in 2016, and the results are striking: Approximately  25\% would sell their votes for  \$418. Democrats and Liberals are systematically more likely to sell, while education levels and income do not seem to impact vote-selling.
