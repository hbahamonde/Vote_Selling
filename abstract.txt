In the nineteenth-century United States vote buying was commonplace. Votes were exchanged for cash, food and alcohol. Nowadays, however, vote-buying seems to have declined considerably. Unfortunately, the literature has put its emphasis on studying vote-buying, ignoring the micro-dynamics of vote-selling. We seem to know that vote-buyers cannot afford this strategy any longer. However, we do not know what American voters would do, if offered the chance to sell their votes. Would they sell their votes (and at what price), or would they consistently opt-out of vote-selling? Given that clientelism is a transaction between buyers (demand side) and sellers (supply side), these efforts are worth pursuing. Exploiting a novel experimental dataset representative at the national level, 1,479 U.S. voters participated in a list experiment in 2016. The results are striking. Approximately 25\% would sell their right to vote freely for \$730. Democrats and liberals are systematically more likely to sell, while education levels and income do not seem to have a systematic impact on vote-selling. By exploiting individual variations, the paper then advances our knowledge about the micro-dynamics of vote-selling in an industrialized country.
