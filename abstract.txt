Many advanced democracies were first very clientelistic political systems. Eventually, vote-buyers could not afford this strategy any longer, not at least in a massive scale, thus making vote-buying a rare event. However, several questions remain unanswered. Most of them pertain to vote-sellers. Has the decline in vote-buying in the United States been paired with improvements in voters' democratic values? What would voters do, if offered the chance to sell their votes? Would they sell their votes (and what price), or would they consciously opt-out of vote-selling because they oppose vote-selling? Given that the emphasis so far has been on vote-buying, prior studies do not offer answers to these questions. I collected a novel dataset of U.S. voters representative at the national level, and performed a list experiment and a conjoint experiment. The results suggest that U.S. voters are very much willing to sell their votes, and that they systematically lie about it. I contend that overlooking the supply side gives the falsely optimistic impression that U.S. voters have healthier democratic values.
